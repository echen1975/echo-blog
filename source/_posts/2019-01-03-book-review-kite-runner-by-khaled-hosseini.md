I read this book twice; first time is Chinese version couple years ago, It is so warm and touchable book, after finished reading <kite Runner> I turned interested in author Khaled Hosseini and read all sister’s books by same author. Surprised to me all of these 3 books 《Kite Runner》 ,《A Thousand Splendid Suns》&《And the Mountains Echoed》 are that kind of books that you are hard to put them down once  you glance. All of them are very warm and tender; shine the power of humanity. 

Kite runner is a very simple story, talking about the friendship and brotherhood between two Afghanistan boys. Amir is the master’s son and Hassan is his servant’s son and also his secrete half-brother. They are best friends and also experts in the art of kite flying. Compared his father- man dares to fight with bear without any weapons, Amir is quiet and little bit timid, in his childhood he was striving to gain his father’s love and recognizing and also jealous of his friend Hassan getting many attentions from his father.

Before war, these two young boys live in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and this year they are going to trying harder than ever to win the local kite-fighting tournament- a popular Afgham pastime, and this is Amir’s one hope of winning his father’s love. But just like the kits battling in the sky, war comes to, and   Afghanistan, and country becomes extremely dangerous place.

In war, people are often forced to make great sacrifices, and the young Amir himself commits an act of betrayal, towards his best friend Hassan no less, which will haunt him for the rest of his life. Amir and his father are forced to flee Afghanistan for America, and The Kite Runner becomes the story of Amir's quest for redemption – righting the wrongs he committed all those years ago as a boy in Kabul.

The story is fast-paced and hardly ever dull, and introduced me to a world – the world of Afghan life – which is strange, fascinating and yet oddly familiar all at the same time. Hosseini's writing finds a great balance between being clear and yet powerful, and not only is the story itself brilliantly constructed, but the book also explores the very art of storytelling. Amir himself becomes a writer, and he reflects on his experiences in the story as though his life itself were a piece of fiction.

But I think the best bit about the kite runner is its sense of fate and justice, of good overcoming evil in the end, despite all odds. Without giving away the ending, Amir ends up back in Afghanistan and makes a very different set of sacrifices in order to set things straight. The final chapter of the book is perhaps my favorite, I was so badly moved and with all the tears in my eyes I finished this book with big sob. I was seeing that under California Sunshine, a middle age man is chasing the flying kite- for you thousands time over.
