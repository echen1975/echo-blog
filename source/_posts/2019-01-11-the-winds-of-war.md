“The Winds of War” Book Review

It is my first time to read historical fiction book about Second World War. To be honest at beginning it was quite overwhelming and there're a lot of challenges. 900 pages book have too many historical events, geography locations also involves really a lot historical figures.  Many words or phrases I either never saw or have no ideas what's the meaning. Like kids learning to walk, I trembled all the way down to the end.  Maybe I just gasp 50% of the book but even this 50% still fascinated me a lot. It is like the Second World War dictionary book. The whole book is filled with all kinds of information and knowledge.  As a Columbia literary major student, Mr. Kouk creatively used a fiction character and based on his narrative to bring all things together and drew a big Second World War picture to all the readers. 



As an old naval soldier and Second World War participator, Herman Wouk has insight view about the war and how the impact on regular citizens and soldiers. An experience he later characterized as educational: "I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans." Meanwhile, as the second generation of Russian Jewish immigrant from what is today Belarus and with childhood indulged with Talmud, Mr. Wouk referenced the plight of Europe’s Jews. In the most disturbing quote in the book, a Jewish historian presented his thoughts on why Christians persecuted Jews.

> “He’s a Jew’s Jesus,” said Jastrow. “That was my point.”

> “Then tell me one thing,” said Rabinovitz. “These Europeans worship a poor murdered Jew, the young Talmud scholar you wrote about so well—to them he’s the Lord God—and yet they go right on murdering Jews. How does a historian explain that?”

> In a comfortable, ironic, classroom tone, most incongruous in the circumstances, Jastrow replied, “Well, you must remember they’re still mostly Norse and Latin pagans at heart. They’ve always chafed under their Jewish Lord’s Talmudic morals, and possibly take out their irritation on his coreligionists.” (Page 818 – 819)

With around 900 pages, The Winds of War traced a naval family’s experiences from the summer of 1939 through the Pearl Harbor attack.  In the process, Mr. Wouk created the most unique literary character I’ve ever encountered in Captain Victor Henry. In a way, he reminded me of Forrest Gump. The captain always seemed to find himself in the middle of many major historical events; At least the ones leading up to the Second World War. While he longed to command a battleship, the brewing “winds of war” swept him up into a fascinating series of positions. At the book’s beginning, he received the post of US Naval Attaché in Berlin. Later he traveled to the UK where he “observed” a bombing raid on Berlin. Following that he received reassignment to Moscow during the German invasion. While serving in these varied locales, he met the war’s most influential figures including Hitler, Churchill, and Stalin. Later as War Plan major participator, he worked closely with FDR (Franklin. D. Roosevelt) and Harry Hopkins. Brought the inside views of why the Lend-lease policy is built, Allies members’ roles in world word two and also the strategic relationship between Axis countries. Mr. Wouk used fiction character a German General Armin von Roon explained the “real meaning of Lend-Lease”:

It was impossible for him – and this he knew – to present the case to his people in realistic terms. Otherwise, he could have told them in effect, “ My friends, this was is for the mastery of the world, Our aim should be to achieve that mastery ourselves, but with a minimum of blood. Let us encourage others to do our fighting for us. Let us give them all the stuff they need to keep fighting. What do we care? In developing the industries to produce this Lend-Lease stuff, we will be preparing ourselves, industries tribally and militarily, for world leadership. They will use up all our early models, our discardable stuff, killing Germans for us. Maybe they will do the whole job for us, but that is doubtful, we will have to step in at the end, but mopping up will be easy. We will have gained a world victory with the expenditure of a lot of hardware, which we can turn out faster, and in greater quantities, than all the world put together, without even feeling the pinch. The others will shed the blood, and we will take the rules” (Page 482).

Also, Mr. Wouk used Armin von Roon described Hitler war strategies. Before I always confused why Hitler opened two war lines at the same time and caused the south Port –Normandy opened to Allied armies.  

> “ The drawback of horsed in war is that they must have hay; Napoleon faltered at Borodino partly from a shortage of fodder.   Similarly, a petroleum engine must have petroleum to burn. Adolf Hitler could never forget this simple fact, no matter how many armchair strategists and shallow clever journalists did”(page 600).

Like “Dream of the Red Chamber”, there are so many things in “the Winds of War” that I learned and gained the knowledge, I may come with couple reviews for this book once I finish whole book. – be honest it is that kind of books they are so fascinate and worth for digging more and many times reading. Hope I can find another chance
