When I recall what was happened last Tuesday what I can image is a mad middle age woman fail  to rebuild her esteem, got lost, disappointed and finally got crazy. Always think I am pretty good at control my emotion and good at turning table around, but at that time I realized that I was as bad as or maybe worse than others.  Reasons that I am emotion stable at most time is because all other peoples are nice to me not because I have higher EQ. Have a teenage kid is a challenge and also a chance for me to learn, to improve and to become better person. Maybe I need add this as another New Year resolution task and hope I can gain something from each conflict
