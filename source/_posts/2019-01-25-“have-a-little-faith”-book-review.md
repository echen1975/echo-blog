After I finished “Tuesday with Morrie”, I start interested in Mitch and like his calm and warm voice dancing around my ears. “Have a little faith” not surprisingly becomes the candidate. 

I got baptized in last May, after baptized I feel the belief or faith is waning, even I still go to church every Sunday morning and still follow regular worship, but somehow I did feel any close, I am not interested in reading bible, tried to read some religion-related books but gave up in middle. Then I turned to book-“Have a little faith”, maybe Mitch can help me something in this book.

 Have a Little Faith begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy.

Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof.

Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat.

As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere.

In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi's last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself.

Have a Little Faith is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story. 



Some profound parts that I remember in this book:

1.    One time rabbi was confronted by his neighbor: one pastor from Germany with a heavy German accent,  with his wife world war II concentration camp experience sliding into his mind, rabbi feels that there has something need to burst but he managed to control it and keep silent. Later on, the Pastor apologized to rabbi and years later they turned to be friends: One Jew and one German carried along with all the scars from the war.

2.    The first time Mitch stepped in Henry’s wobbly church and introduced to Henry. When 400 lbs Henry walked along the corridor and introduced himself to Mitch, the first impression is overwhelming; Mitch told himself that if this man is a pastor then it is the man from Mar
