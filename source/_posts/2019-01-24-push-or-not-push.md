Time flies haven’t noticed 8 years have passed, servicing in the same company in the same position for more than 8 years is very strange behavior and unbelievable thing to me.  I was always full of ambitious and always ready to make some new changes or sometimes sharp turn.  In my life philosophy, I trust hard work, and trust to make opportunities. And always believe life is full of potentials if we keep trying.  20 years later at the middle of 40 I realized that somehow I have lost all my ambitions. 

I dreamed to be an entrepreneur or a successful businesswoman. I always believe that I have the capabilities to do something; with two master degrees in hands, I was ready to new life. But life does not dream, as a first generation immigrate there are so many obstacles that I need to overcome, language, culture, immigration status and so on.  Also with two kids joined there has not a lot of options for me to select.  Find a job that can balance between family and work becomes my key issue, no long distance commute,   flexible working schedule, minimize business trip, no overtime working task and no …. I feel I never be able to grasp my dreams, they are like balloons filled with helium flying high and far, Finally I can’ reach them anymore.  

I worked as tester even this is one kind of job that I disliked at all, every time when I feel bored and tired with this tedious work I try to persuade myself that at least I have decent job with nice payment, at least my kids are happy and healthy, at least we got solid finance and we have so-called American dream   (two cars, two kids and big house).  Now 8 years past, kids are more independent, maybe it is time to think what I want to do, with more than 20 years of career span left, maybe it is the time that I can do something to challenge myself, maybe I can push myself to find my potential, maybe it is time to find my real interest, maybe…. 

I know I need to do something, I need to knock doors, maybe one of the doors will open for me.  I tried to contact with Sanjay to propose my will and get a soft reject, then I tried with  Bheemesh team, I don’t know whether this time I can make it, if not I will keep trying for another team.  That God is Light, and in Him, there is no darkness at all\[John 1:5]. Let’s have some faith !!!!!
