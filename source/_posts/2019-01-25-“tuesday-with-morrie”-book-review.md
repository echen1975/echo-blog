I was searching on the internet and trying to find some interesting books, “Tuesday with Morrie” was popped up at the top 10 recommended 2018 reading list by author Mitch Albom. I never heard this book before and also no idea of Mitch Albom, but it will not hurt to give a glimpse. My journey with Morris started at cold New Jersey January winter, even outer side was freezing cold with winter winds howling fearfully, surrounded with Mitch’s soft and warm voice and indulged with Morrie’s story I started to think….

"Tuesdays with Morrie" (TWM) is more than just a dying man's last words. It is an inspirational recount of a man's life -- a man whose passion for the human spirit has continued to live long after his last breath.

This book was not planned; at the beginning, Mitch wanted to publish this book to get some money to cover the medical cost for Morrie, but this 16 week Tuesdays with Morrie exploring many of life’s fundamental issues – family, marriage, aging, and culture to name a few. Morrie was giving his last lecture while Mitch was writing his final thesis.

Take aging -- an issue many struggles with. As his disease progresses, Morrie finds himself dealing with aging in a more concentrated way than most. When Mitch asks him how he is able to refrain from being jealous of the young, Morrie says, "It's like going back to being a child again. Someone to bathe you. Someone to lift you. Someone to wipe you. We all know how to be a child. It's inside all of us. For me, it's just remembering how to enjoy it." With wonderful insight, Morrie continues, "We all yearn in some way to return to those days when we were completely taken care of -- unconditional love, unconditional caring. Most of us didn't get enough." Now if that isn't getting the most of an unfortunate situation, I don't know what is!

But aging for most isn't about a rapidly degenerative disease like ALS. Most of us face aging on our 30th, 40th and 50th birthdays -- when we yearn for the carefree days of youth. Morrie has something to say about those who want to be young again. He says that's a reflection of a life that hasn't found meaning. He says if you've found meaning you don't want to go back, and you can appreciate the 23-year-old in you, the 35-year-old and the 62-year-old.

Some of Morrie's greatest insights are his views on how our culture plays into our lives. He spent his life creating his own culture, listening to his heart and doing what was right for him, versus what was right by society's standards. One problem he sees is that we tend to see each other as dissimilar rather than alike. We are taught to be independent and unique, but in reality, we all have the same needs. He emphasizes investment in people, not things. When all is said and done, we will be remembered not by our bank accounts or stock portfolios, but by the time we spent listening to a friend or helping a family member.

Morrie speaks to every person because he is every person. He has led a simple yet meaningful life that inspires you to live yours to the fullest. Perhaps his story is more powerful because you're not only taking in his wisdom, but you are experiencing his death. In his words, he is fortunate enough to know he is dying, to take stock of his life as it comes to an end. He handles this with bravery and compassion, and when the final moment comes you feel as though you've lost a dear friend.
