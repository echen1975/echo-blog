Book brought reader to the time of 1980 west of America, harsh, sterile, desert area.  At border of US, one group of drug smugglers involved in gun fight and dead left one suit case with 2 million dollars for new owner.  

Story involve 3 part of people

the county sheriff. The old Texas sheriffs served as law men. Ed Tom Bell, a happily married, decorated second world war veteran, is respectful of life, He care a lot about people in his country and represent himself as law men and protector.

Llewelyn Moss, a Vietnam veteran and welder who lives in the county, on his way to deer hunting he accidently saw the gun fight and found the blood money, 

Chigurh , cold blood professional killer and a blood chasing guy . Taking his new task to bring the 2 million money back. the blood chasing game is on.

Like the old traditional west story, the innocent people is trying to running away from his devastated life, with the murder is chasing tightly at his back. the sheriff -represent the savor or protector is trying to protect his citizen. But not like the traditional story, the sheriff always one step behind the murder, even the innocent people is war veteran and quite strong surviving skill, the murder did reach his goal and got the blood money.

As book named: no country for old man, -- in this book, Sheriff Bell is represent Old Man, also represent author’s disappointment about current world, at the end of book, Sheriff Bell had his long italicised monologues” Suck it up, Bell. The world is changing. The nights are hot. There are too many people, too many advertisements that make everyone crazy for expensive junk, that pump up egos and the sense of a right to gratification. There is too much money lying around in satchels."

This book uses a lot of double negative sentence and also using many southern slangs. I stopped quite sometime to try to gasp the actually meaning of the sentences for many double negative word.
